# LangChain* - Intel® GenAI Reference Samples

Various Intel® hardware and LangChain based examples are provided. Different parts of the workload can be distributed across edge, on-prem, or a CSP devices/infrastructure.

| Demo  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <b>Public archive</b> - [chapterization](chapterization) | <b>This sample was archived by the owner on August 14th, 2025. It is now read-only.</b> Demonstrates an pipeline which automatically chapterizes long text/content from a provided audio context. The primary components utilize OpenVINO™ in LangChain* for audio-speech-recognition, embeddings generation, K-means clustering, and LLM chapterization.  |
| <b>Public archive</b> - [qna](qna)  | <b>This sample was archived by the owner on August 14th, 2025. It is now read-only.</b> Demonstrates a pipeline which performs QnA using audio or text with RAG. The primary components utilize OpenVINO™ in LangChain for audio-speech-recognition, LLM text generation/response, and text-to-speech.   |
| [video-summarization](video-summarization)  | Summarize Videos Using OpenVINO Model Server, Langchain, and MiniCPM-V-2_6.  |
| <b> Public archive</b> - [eval-text-summarization-benchmarking](genai-eval-text-summarization-benchmarking)  | <b>This sample was archived by the owner on August 14th, 2025. It is now read-only.</b> Perform a qualitative assessment of a candidate summarization by comparing it to a reference response. Metrics calculated are BLEU, ROUGE-N, and BERTScore  |
